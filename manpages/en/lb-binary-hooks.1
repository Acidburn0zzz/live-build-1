.SH NAME
\fBlive\-build\fR \- Live System Build Components

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlb binary\-hooks\fR [\-\-verbose]
.PP
\fBlb binary\-hooks\fR [\-\-help]
.br
\fBlb binary\-hooks\fR [\-\-version]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
live\-build contains the components to build a live system from a configuration directory.
.PP
The \fBlb binary\-hooks\fR command executes hook files after the binary stage.

.SH SPECIFICATION
\fBlb binary\-hooks\fR executes any hook files found in the \fBconfig/hooks\fR directory within the configuration directory.
.PP
Hook files do not require to have a specific owner nor specific permissions. They are marked executable by \fBlb binary\-hooks\fR automatically when they are executed.
.PP
Hook files must either have the suffix \fB*.hook\fR or \fB*.hook.binary\fR.
.PP
Hook files with the suffix \fB*.hook\fR are executed first, hook files with the suffix \fB*.hook.binary\fR are executed second.
.PP
Hook files are executed in alphanumberical order by \fBlb binary\-hooks\fR. If one hook file depends on being run after another, best practise is to use number prefixes (nnnn, starting with 0001) to ensure the order of execution.
.PP
Hook files are copied into the \fBbinary/live-build\fR directory by \fBlb binary\-hooks\fR. They are executed from within the binary directory and can read the configuration directory in \fBlive-build/config\fR within the binary directory.
.PP
\fBWarning:\fR hook files are not executed within a chroot but within the context of the host system in the binary directory. They have root privileges and access to the all host system ressources (devices, filesystems, network, etc.).
