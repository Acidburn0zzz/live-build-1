.SH SPECIFICATION
\fBlb chroot\-includes\fR copies any include files found in the \fBconfig/includes\fR and \fBconfig/includes.chroot\fR directories within the configuration directory.
.PP
Include files do not require to have a specific owner nor specific permissions. The files are set to be owned by root by \fBlb chroot\-includes\fR automatically when they are copied, original permissions of the files are preserved. Specific owners can be set with a corresponding hook file, see \fIlb-chroot-hooks\fR(1) for more information about hooks.
.PP
