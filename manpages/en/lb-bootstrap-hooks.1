.SH NAME
\fBlive\-build\fR \- Live System Build Components

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR [\-\-verbose]
.PP
\fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR [\-\-help]
.br
\fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR [\-\-version]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
live\-build contains the components to build a live system from a configuration directory.
.PP
The \fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR command executes hook files after the bootstrap stage.

.SH SPECIFICATION
\fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR executes any hook files found in the \fBconfig/hooks\fR directory within the configuration directory.
.PP
Hook files do not require to have a specific owner nor specific permissions. They are marked executable by \fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR automatically when they are executed.
.PP
Hook files must either have the suffix \fB*.hook\fR or \fB*.hook.bootstrap\fR.
.PP
Hook files with the suffix \fB*.hook\fR are executed first, hook files with the suffix \fB*.hook.bootstrap\fR are executed second.
.PP
Hook files are executed in alphanumberical order by \fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR. If one hook file depends on being run after another, best practise is to use number prefixes (nnnn, starting with 0001) to ensure the order of execution.
.PP
Hook files are copied into the \fBchroot/live-build\fR directory by \fBlb bootstrap\-hooks\fR. They are executed from within the chroot directory (chrooted) and can read the configuration directory in \fB/live-build/config\fR within the chroot directory.
